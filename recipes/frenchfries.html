    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large russet potato, cut into evenly sized strips</li>
        <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak potato strips in a large bowl of water for about 30 minutes. Pat with paper towels until thoroughly dry.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Gently add potatoes to the hot oil and fry for about 5 minutes, stirring and flipping the potatoes occasionally. Use a slotted spoon to transfer potatoes to a paper towel-lined plate. Let cool completely.</li>
        <li>Heat oil again, but this time to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Add potatoes and fry a second time until golden brown, 5 to 6 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Remove from the deep-fryer and blot with a paper towel. Sprinkle with salt to serve.</li>
    </ol>
